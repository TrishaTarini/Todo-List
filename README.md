Objective
 Develop a simple full-stack application that includes both front-end and back-end
 components.
Instructions
 Use a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js to create the user interface. Use
 Node.js, Django, or another back-end framework to handle server-side logic.
 Integrate a database to store user data and other relevant information. Implement
 user authentication (e.g., login, registration) to secure the application. Deploy your
 application on a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Netlify. Upload your complete
 application, including deployment scripts, to your GitHub repository.
